# README

Experiment in modelling decision trees

See doc/initial-decision-tree.png for the initial decision tree being modeled

# Design Goals

* The decision tree is encapsulated in a single file which is easy to understand and modify

* Each question is contained in a single ERB template, easy to find and modify

* Adding new questions is straightforward

Provided these goals are acheived, I don't care if the code is a bit clunky
